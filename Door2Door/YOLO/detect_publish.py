"""
detect_publish.py - watch the laptop camera with our trained YOLO model,
compute a motor speed to park the car at the camera's center, and publish
both over MQTT.

The camera is stationary (not mounted on the car): it watches the car --
which carries the green minifig as its own marker -- drive back and forth
along a straight track. This closes the loop the same way
aprilTags/apriltag_pd_tracker.py does elsewhere in this repo: the marker's
horizontal pixel position is the measurement, the frame's horizontal center
is the fixed setpoint, and PD control turns "how far off-center" into a
single forward/backward speed applied to both motors (sign-corrected for
mirror-mounting via RIGHT_MOTOR_SIGN) -- there is no left/right steering at
all, same as that script.

Single-class model (just "Minifig") -- publishes to one topic:
  ME193/Luca/green

Message (JSON):
  {"x": 412.0, "y": 230.5, "w": 640, "h": 480, "conf": 0.91,
   "left": -80, "right": 80}
  x, y = center of the minifig's box in pixels; w, h = camera frame size;
  left, right = the same PD-controlled forward/backward speed
  (-255..255), applied to both motors (right sign-corrected for
  mirror-mounting -- see RIGHT_MOTOR_SIGN).
Nothing is sent for a frame with no detection - the UnoQ stops the motors
on its own if messages stop arriving for too long (see
ArduinoApps/mqtt-minifig-drive/python/main.py's CONTROL_TIMEOUT).

Why the control math lives here instead of on the UnoQ: this way, tuning
the gains below is just editing this file and rerunning it -- no App Lab
redeploy needed. The Kp/Kd/Max Speed/Deadzone/Max Step/Smoothing/Pulse ms
trackbars on the preview window let you retune live, without even
restarting the script.

Pulse ms shapes the motor into short bursts instead of holding a speed
continuously for the whole gap between control updates: shortly after each
nonzero command is published, an explicit stop is published too, timed off
the camera's own frame loop (so it is not limited to the Send Rate Hz
cadence). The UnoQ side needs no changes for this at all -- main.py already
just applies whatever left/right it was last told, so publishing a "go"
and then a "stop" from here is enough. Keep Pulse ms shorter than the Send
Rate interval (1000 / Send Rate Hz, in ms) or the next real command will
usually land before the stop would have mattered.

If it still overshoots with Kd at 0 and Kp low, the cause usually is not
the gains at all -- it's noise: YOLO's detected box center jitters a few
pixels frame to frame even for a stationary target, and/or there's real
lag between a motor command and the camera actually seeing its effect
(inference time + MQTT round trip + physical motor response). The
Smoothing trackbar low-pass-filters the raw detected x position itself,
every camera frame, before it ever reaches the controller -- this damps
jitter-driven overshoot in a way that lowering Kp/Kd alone cannot, since
those gains don't distinguish real motion from noise.
